# ☕ Coffee Shop Dashboard


## Overview & Key Features
Interactive Tableau dashboard showing **sales performance and customer behavior** across multiple regions, product types and time periods. Features include:
   1. **Global filtering** - The dashboard is fully interactive. Clicking on a filter on the filter menu, or at any data point on the screen will filter all other charts on the dashboard.
   2. **Year-over-Year analysis** - All primary KPIs automatically compare performance for the selected year against the previous year.
   3. **Detailed tooltips** - Hovering over any chart element reveals detailed information and exact figures.

The dashboard is split into two segments, each tackling different business problems:
## 🔹 Sales
   * Are sales and order volumes improving over the years? Which months do we typically hit highs and lows?
   * Which coffee types and roast profiles drive the most revenue?
   * Which product pack sizes are most popular and where should inventory focus land?
   * How does profit track against sales over time?


## 🔸 Customers
   * How many active buyers and orders exist over the selected period?
   * Where are customers located and how concentrated is customer value geographically?
   * What is the typical order frequency?
   * Who are our most profitable customers?

## Who is the dashboard for & How do they benefit?
   1. **Coffee shop owners and managers** who need a clear view of how sales, products and customers perform over time.
        * Quickly identify seasonal peaks and slower months to plan promotions or staffing.
   2. **Marketing and customer engagement teams** who want to understand buying patterns, top-value customers, and opportunities for retention campaigns.
        * Spot customer concentration and loyalty patterns, enabling targeted marketing and retention programs.
   3. **Operations and inventory planners** who must balance production and stock levels with real sales data and product mix.
        * Understand which items drive revenue and margin, guiding procurement and menu decisions.
